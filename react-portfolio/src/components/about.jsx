      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a 33 year old software development student. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through edX and Case Western Reserve University. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, SQL and PostgresSQL. I have worked for the last 13 and a half years as a Land Surveyor and am looking forward to transitioning into the field of software development. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, which I have done for 27 years, playing video games, and livestreaming on Twitch.
